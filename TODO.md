### TODO

---

- [x] Adding more sites. Then, if necessary storing them in a yml file.
- [ ] Using bs4 to get error messages
- As search4's main objective is to search for a particular username on almost every social-platform, so we don't want to loose any site. But, since currently search4 uses web-responses to fetch details, many other sites don't give a bad response when a username is not found on the site, instead they give error messages. So, to get the error messages will need to use bs4.
- [x] Adding a list of sites available to use.
