## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

It is a python script using which you can search a username on almost every social media platform. You can see that on how many social media platforms a particular username exists. 

This script works on the response of web servers and searches that username on their web servers on your behalf, in a single execution. It takes it less than a minute to do so.
