## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

It is a python script using which you can search a username on almost every social media platform. You can see that on how many social media platforms a particular username exists. 

This script works on the response of web servers and searches that username on their web servers on your behalf, in a single execution. It takes it less than a minute to do so.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

We had planned to automate the following & add a feature,  but it seems not possible for now. [See issues#5](https://github.com/7rillionaire/Search4/issues/5)

But then [alias](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/alias-command-in-linux-with-examples/amp/) can be useful.

```
mv search4.py $HOME

alias search4='python3 search 4.py'

```
[Always make sure while using search4 you are in $HOME](https://github.com/7rillionaire/Search4/issues/5)
